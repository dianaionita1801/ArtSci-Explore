The "ArtSci Explore" project aims to create an ingenious Unity-based personalized museum journey using an AI recommender. The users begin by completing a personality quiz, determining their inclination towards art or science. Utilizing a virtual guide powered by artificial intelligence, the system efficiently navigates users through the museum, presenting exhibits that have a higher probability to spark interest in the user. This project has the objective to encourage a larger number of people to manifest more interest and passion towards culture, art and science.
